NEED TO BE INSTALLED:
=====================
1. supervisor
   command "sudo apt-get install supervisor"
   installed outside virtualenv

2. Gunicorn
   installed inside virtualenv via PIP
   command "pip install gunicorn"

3. Nginx web server
   command "sudo apt-get install nginx"

IMPORTANT:
** files :
    - gunicorn_init_script.sh
    - nginx_server.conf
    - supervisor_conf_file.conf

can be renamed to anything, but its better to make it understandable.

** gunicorn script should be placed at inside django project.

** If each conf and script file require Username, put current username you are now.(unix username, in my case "/home/ekaputra" -> username "ekaputra" and group "ekaputra"

** gunicorn script should be in executable permission, "chmod +x script.sh"
